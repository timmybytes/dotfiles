**[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)** is a powerful terminal emulator that renders lightening fast, thanks in part to how it offloads rendering to the GPU. I've recently started using it after having some lagging issues with iTerm2, and so far it's pretty great. However, there are enough differences in kitty's approach to keybindings vs iTerm that these settings are currently not advisable to use, as I still have a lot of tweaking to do.
