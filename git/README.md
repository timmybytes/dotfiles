# Git

This directory contains my preferred settings and helper functionality for git.
Note these are just _my_ settings, and may break or be incompatible with your own
setup.

## .gitconfig

```sh
[user]
        name = Timothy Merritt
        email = xxx@xxx.xxx
[color]
        ui = auto
[filter "lfs"]
        required = true
        clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
        smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
        process = git-lfs filter-process
[init]
        defaultBranch = main
```

### Commit Message Conventions

The [commit conventions document](./commit-conventions.txt) serves as a template for git commit messages. For configuation instructions:

> ðŸ“– Read my article on [Keeping Git Commit Messages Consistent with a Custom Template](https://dev.to/timmybytes/keeping-git-commit-messages-consistent-with-a-custom-template-1jkm).

For information on Semantic Versioning conventions, [see the spec](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver).

#### Commit messages should adhere to the following conventions:
